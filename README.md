# PNG Decoder in C
   A simple PNG Decoder made using zlib in C by translating [python script](https://pyokagan.name/blog/2019-10-14-png/).
   This decoder supports only 8 bit truecolor with alpha png images (RGBA images) and doesn't support interlacing.
   Best image to decode are 32x32.

   I've done this to challenge my self into translating other language script into another and get in touch with C again after some time.
   The most challenging part was understanding how to translate the zlib python functions to C ones and convert zlib data into SDL2 a texture.
